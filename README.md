# MapsAsGraphs

### Concepts:
MapsAsGraphs is a Google Map application which can output the optimal route between two points 
(intersections or cities etc) using one of Breadth First Search, Dijkstra's or A-Star Algorithm.

**Phase 1:**  Translating data to graphs

**Phase 2:**  Route planning using algorithms
